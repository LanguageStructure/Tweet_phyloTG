# 1 (Introduction)

Tupí-Guaraní (TG) is the largest linguistic family of South-America. Little is knwon about its spread (genes and languages). Historical linguistics has tools to investigate such issue. Even more when aided by digital data, computers, and methods from evolutionary biology.

# 2 (Data)

We build linguistic trees from open-access reusable data in CLDF lifted with EDICTOR from TuLeD (abc concepts in xx TG langs, zab words) with phylogenetic softwares

# 3 (Goal)

Linguistic trees display classifications comparable with results from other fields (Archaeology, Ethnography, History). We test a model on the data only, then aggregate information (langs, archaeo, hist.), evaluate hypotheses, and accordignly improve data and model.

# 4 (Explaining a model)

Evolutionary methods: we start from simple ones (NJ) to highly complex (MCMC) delivering millions of trees. Deriving a single tree that best summarizes the results is the challenge.

# 5 (Preliminary RESULTS)

Mawetí-Guaraní hypothesis recognized. Fast expansion of the Guaraní slows ca. year 1580. 4 major groups identified. Blue group supports ethnogr/hist/ling evidence: dialect continuum, common area of origin, close contact. 

# 6 (To do and REFS)


Collect more hist. information, improve cognacy. Cogancy alone is not all include other ling. data. Constrain and calibrate model(s) (dates, geography, ratios, monophyletic groups).
